Modern, minimal container-based build/development tool to make any projectÂ´s dev easy and frictionless.

![](docs/demo-screencast.gif)


What is this?
-------------

Turbo Bob (the builder) is an abstraction for building and developing your software, whether it happens in your laptop or in a CI system.

Usage of Turbo Bob, in every project you're developing:

```
$ bob dev
```

This gives you a shell inside the build environment container with the working directory mounted inside the container so that you can directly edit your code files from your host system.

To build your project:

```
$ bob build
```

By keeping these commands consistent across each project we'll minimize friction with
mental context switching, since the commands are the same for each project whether
you're building a Docker-based image or running anything custom that produces build
artefacts.

There's a [document that your project can link to](docs/external-how-to-build-and-dev.md)
for build & help instructions. This explains Bob's value proposition quite well and serves
as the first introduction for new Bob users. See an
[example of a project's build docs linking to Bob](https://github.com/function61/ruuvinator#how-to-build--develop).


Philosophy
----------

- Your project must support a simple `build` and `dev` interface. If you can't, you're
  probably doing something wrong and you should simplify it. The `build` command usually just
  runs your project's `bin/build.sh` (or equivalent) command inside a container. The `dev`
  command usually starts Bash terminal inside the container but doesn't execute `bin/build.sh`
  so you can manually invoke or debug the build process (or a subset of it).

- Build environment should be stateless & immutable. No longer missing build tools or
  mismatched versions within your team. Nothing to install on your CI server (except Docker).

- Decouple build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies
  ([build container pattern](https://medium.com/@alexeiled/docker-pattern-the-build-container-b0d0e86ad601)),
  so build tools will not be shipped to production (smaller images & less attack surface).

- Dev/CI/production environment parity as close as possible. Dev environment is the same as
  build & CI environment. What's built on dev (`$ bob build`) is exactly the same or as
  close as possible (`$ bob build --uncommitted`) as to what will end up running in production.

- No vendor lock-in for a CI system. Bob can seamlessly build projects on your laptop, Jenkins,
  Travis, GitLab etc. CI needs to only provide the working directory and Docker - everything
  else like uploading artefacts to S3, Bintray etc. should be a build container concern to
  provide full independence.


Install
-------

Requires Docker for use, so currently only Linux is supported. Windows support might come
later as Windows' Linux subsystem keeps maturing.

```
$ VERSION_TO_DOWNLOAD="..." # find this from Bintray. Looks like: 20180828_1449_b9d7759cf80f0b4a
$ sudo curl --location --fail --output /usr/local/bin/bob "https://dl.bintray.com/function61/dl/turbobob/$VERSION_TO_DOWNLOAD/bob_linux-amd64" && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bob
```


Supported build/CI platforms
----------------------------

Basic approach anywhere:

1. Have Docker installed
2. If you don't have Turbo Bob installed, download it
3. Run `$ bob build`


### Your own computer

If your system can run Docker locally, you can build projects on your own computer.


### GitHub actions

See [example actions workflow file](https://github.com/function61/buildkit-publisher/commit/62f1b71ed6a17489394ccd431763ee36c958fb92).
That commit also demonstrates how portable Bob is by moving from Travis CI -> GitHub
actions - how it's just from small boilerplate to small boilerplate.

GitHub actions' design is pretty similar to Turbo Bob's design ("run stuff inside containers").
I started this project before actions was announced, so unfortunately there's currently no
synergy with these projects. I'd like to research if Bob concepts could directly be mapped
into actions' concepts (perhaps you could just generate actions' workflow file from
turbobob.json).


### Travis CI

Turbo Bob is being built on Travis CI. See our [Travis configuration](.travis.yml).
(also deeper dive on "[How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)" -section).


### GitLab

I've build projects on GitLab's public runners. See
[example configuration](https://github.com/function61/turbobob/blob/8156ab2bc400181cb74b8ea324fa98a3fb9e82d2/cmd/bob/init.go#L56).


### Other CI systems

Bob's approach is pretty generic. You can see from Travis or GitLab configuration files
that they just download Bob's binary first and hand off build to it.

Bob internally pretty much just calls `$ docker` commands, so you should be able to port
Bob anywhere where you've got Docker. If you've done so, please add details here to help others.


Examples
--------

A few sample projects that shows how Turbo Bob is used for builds:

- [function61/james](https://github.com/function61/james)
	- uses buildkit [function61/buildkit-golang](https://github.com/function61/buildkit-golang)
- [function61/lambda-alertmanager](https://github.com/function61/lambda-alertmanager)
	- uses buildkit [function61/buildkit-js](https://github.com/function61/buildkit-js)
- [function61/home-automation-hub](https://github.com/function61/home-automation-hub)
	- uses *both* Go- and JS buildkits (which neatly demoes the hygiene of keeping different
	ecosystems' build tools separate - they could even run different distros!)

What is a buildkit? It's not strictly a Turbo Bob concept - it only means that instead of
constructing the whole build environment in your own repo in the `build-default.Dockerfile`, that
Dockerfile is mostly empty and most of its configuration comes from the `FROM` image referenced
in the Dockerfile from another repo. This makes for smaller build Dockerfiles (but you can
still do customizations). This makes builds faster and increases standardization and
reusability across projects whose build environments will be similar anyways.


How does it work?
-----------------

This very project is built with Bob on Travis. [Travis configuration](.travis.yml) is minimal - it basically just:

- Requires Docker
- Downloads Turbo Bob
- Copies `TRAVIS_COMMIT` ENV variable to `CI_REVISION_ID` and
- Asks Bob to do the rest:

The process is exactly the same whether you use a different CI system. You can even run builds exactly the same way on your laptop by just running `$ bob build`.

Here's what happens when a new commit lands in this repo:

- Github notifies Travis of a new commit
- Travis clones repo, reads [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) which downloads Bob and hands off
  build process to it
- Bob reads [turbobob.json](turbobob.json)
- `turbobob.json` tells Bob:
  * Run container off of image `fn61/buildkit-golang`
    ([repo](https://github.com/function61/buildkit-golang)) and run
    [bin/build.sh](bin/build.sh) inside it.
  * For publishing step, run container off of image `fn61/buildkit-publisher`
    ([repo](https://github.com/function61/buildkit-publisher)) and run `publish.sh rel/`
    inside it (that shell script is from the image itself, while the build container's
    `build.sh` was from our repo)

Why different images for build + publish steps? The build tooling image was for Go
development. If we were developing a Rust project, we could still reuse the publish image
for publishing our build artefacts.
