ENV vars passed to build containers
===================================


List of all ENV variables
-------------------------

Each CI like Travis CI, GitLab, GitHub actions etc. passes the revision ID from the VCS in
a different variable. Bob normalizes that into these variables listed here:

| Var               | Example                | Description                                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FRIENDLY_REV_ID` | 20200219_1609_9c39d027 | Commit's date + time + short rev ID. Good for human readability / Docker tags while still being autogenerated |
| `REV_ID`          | 9c39d0271d0bd51c7ddfb55dc3051e68b6953c33 | Full hash of the commit |
| `REV_ID_SHORT`    | 9c39d027               | REV_ID but shorter (8 hexits), still really low chance of collision |
| `FASTBUILD`       | true                   | Present only if running `$ bob build --fast` |
| `BUILD_*` (many)  | true                   | Explained in the other table              |


OS / arch ENV variables
-----------------------

The `BUILD_<os>_<arch>` variables tell which Operating System / Architecture combos to build for.

The naming follows [Go's OS & Arch codes](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment).

If your project builds for Linux OS with AMD64 CPU architecture, there will be an
environment variable with `BUILD_LINUX_AMD64=true`.

Why have knowledge of this on Bob level? When doing quick development iteration builds,
you want the builds to be fast. `$ bob build` builds for all combos that your project
targets. `$ bob build --fast` and `$ bob dev` builds only for the OS/arch that you're
currently running in.
